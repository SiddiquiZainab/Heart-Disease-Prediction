# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The heart is one of the most important organs in the human body. It pumps blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells and tissues. Diagnosing heart disease is crucial because early detection improves treatment outcomes. It can reduce mortality and improve the quality of life for people.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning models and ensemble methods. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes. Evaluations are done using the Cleveland dataset.

## Models
The following machine learning models are used in this project:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Ensemble Method
An ensemble method is used to combine the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness. Using the Soft Voting method, the three best-performing ML models are used for making the final prediction. The structure is as follows:

These metrics indicate that the ensemble model outperforms the base models in predicting heart disease. It can balance both precision (correctly identifying those with the disease) and recall (correctly identifying those without the disease).

## Applications
The heart disease prediction model has several potential applications in healthcare:
- Early Diagnosis: Assists healthcare providers in identifying patients at high risk of heart disease, allowing for early intervention.
- Personalized Treatment Plans: Helps tailor treatment plans based on the predicted risk, improving patient outcomes.
- Timely Alerts: Provide patients with timely alerts based on their health data, encouraging proactive health management.
- Continuous Monitoring: Enables continuous monitoring of patients with a history of heart disease, ensuring they receive appropriate care.
